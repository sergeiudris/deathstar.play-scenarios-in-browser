# play-scenarios-in-browser
a browser-only app to play scenarios, single player and/or multiplayer

## what and why

- how to convey game idea to others? fancy design? well, it's basically GUI
- so the best way to explain the idea of this new type of games and Death Star in particular, is to have an approximation of GUI to play scenarios
- and it's great for the game to start coming up with scenarios
- so this will be a browser-only app with a list of game scenarios to play
- the app will be deployed to github.io so anyone can play scenarios
- single player definitely, look into multiplayer
- the app should be an approxiamtion/in-the-direction of real GUI for the game (in terms of gameplay)
